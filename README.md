Install Requirements:                                                                                                        
1、PyTroch>=0.4.1                                                                                                                             
2、torchvision>=0.2.1 			                                                    																			                             
3、opencv-python>=3.4.2

5、4 nvidia GPUs(we use 4 nvidia titanX)                                                                                      

Training                                                                                                                     
This code supprts for Syndata and icdar2015, and we will release the training code for IC13 and IC17 as soon as possible.
